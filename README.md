# CLAMSwrangler-web
![](/static/images/v0.8-alpha.png)

To simplify and expedite the processing of the raw data generated by the [Oxymax Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring
System (Oxymax-CLAMS)](https://www.colinst.com/products/clams-comprehensive-lab-animal-monitoring-system) we developed CLAMS Wrangler.

This program handles the cleaning, trimming, binning, and reformatting of data generated by Oxymax-CLAMS for downstream statistical analysis.

# Usage
Visit the [CLAMS Wrangler (coming soon)]() website to process your data.

Please visit the [documentation](https://pistillilab.github.io/CLAMSwrangler-web/) for a more detailed explanation of using CLAMS Wrangler and whether it is right for your use case.

# Running locally
While we will make every effort possible to maintain the availability of the website once deployed, that may not always be the case. If the website is unavailable, you can run the website locally on your computer and process data that way.

To download the latest version of CLAMS Wrangler go to the [releases](https://github.com/PistilliLab/CLAMSwrangler-web/releases) page.

Alternatively, run ```git clone https://github.com/PistilliLab/CLAMSwrangler-web.git``` from a terminal.

### Depenencies
Install all dependencies as defined in the **requirements.txt** file. You will also need to install [redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) as it is currently used as the database for Celery, which handles asynchronous task processing.

### Start server
From a python environment with all dependencies installed, you can start the server with ```python manage.py runserver```. 
You will also need to start the Celery worker in a separate terminal to process tasks with ```celery -A CLAMS_web worker --loglevel=info```.
If you have multiple environments running, such as conda and the venv for the project, disable all but the one environment with the required dependencies. 
Navigate to ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/```.
