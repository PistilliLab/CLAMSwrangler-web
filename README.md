# CLAMSwrangler
![v1.0.2](/screenshots/CLAMSwrangler.png)

To simplify and expedite the processing of the raw data generated by the [Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring
System (CLAMS)](https://www.colinst.com/products/clams-comprehensive-lab-animal-monitoring-system) we developed CLAMS Wrangler.

This program handles the cleaning, trimming, binning, and reformatting of data generated by CLAMS for downstream statistical analysis.

# Usage

# Download program
To download the latest version of CLAMS Wrangler go to the [releases](https://github.com/PistilliLab/CLAMSwrangler/releases) page and select the version for the OS you are using.
