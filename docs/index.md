Welcome to the CLAMS Wrangler documentation!

The documentation presented here and the application itself are still under active development. 

Documentation is divided into two sections.

## For Biologists
*For biologists* covers aspects of the software relevant to processing data generated by Oxyamx-CLAMS. This includes preparation of data, any pre-processing that needs to be done, defining settings in the application, and what processing is done by the application on the provided data.

## For Developers
*For developers* describes the functions used for processing, libraries used, and overall application structure.
