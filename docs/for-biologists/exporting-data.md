To begin analysis, first you need to export the data collected by the Oxymax-CLAMS calorimeter machine. This will 
convert the data to a more human-readable format, specifically the *.csv* filetype.

## Export data
To export your raw data in *.csv* format follow the steps below.

1. Click on **File** in the software.
2. Click **Export**.
3. Then **Export subject CSVs**.

## Saving raw data files
It is highly recommended to save the raw files in the Oxymax-CLAMS specific filetypes for data preservation. If there are 
any issues with the .csv file, you can re-export the data from the original data files.
